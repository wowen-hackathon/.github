# Hackaton structure

The 1st Swiss Modular Blockchain Hackathon consists of two parts:

1. Full day in person kick-off day in Zürich (Introducing to Wowen & head-first start into your projects, hacking, community event).

2. Two weeks ongoing coding and submission period, starting Sunday 28th May, until 11th June 20 PM (Zürich time) submission deadline.

# Rules

1. Participants must fill in the following [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6oht3VDXbVNCfSD88), in order to be invited to [Wowen Hackathon](https://github.com/wowen-hackathon) GitHub Organisation.

2. Hackers can group up and work in teams (up to 6 members) or solo to solve one of the challenges proposed. You can participate in only **one** team.

3. Participants must commit their project to the previously assigned GitHub repository not later than 11th June 20 PM (Zürich time).

4. Each project should include:

    - Project’s name with a short description and relevant source code.

    - Contract address(es) or website URLs of your deployed application (NOT mandatory).

    - Video demo (NOT mandatory).

    - Presentation (NOT mandatory).

# Special hackathon day bounty

Create a dApp on Wowen Modular Blockchain for claiming the 100 Hacker NFT Badges!

- Bounty prize: 200 CHF + crate of beers.

- Submission deadline 27/05/2023 before 16:00 PM, if you want to participate to this special bounty, ask Roberto to create a special repository for you or your team!

- Badges available at [NFTs](https://api.wowen.io/manager/static/nft/hackathon/) (append X.png, where X is the NFT number. E.g. https://api.wowen.io/manager/static/nft/hackathon/1.png).

- Winner will be chosen based dApp functionality, usability & design (e.g., NFT visible from the dApp, automatic add to MetaMask, etc.).

- Winner announcement: 17:30 PM.

# Challenges

## Create your dream dApp

Currently, Ethereum holds the majority share in the EVM-based ecosystem but is hindered by its high costs. Also, enveloping a dApp often involves being restricted by the performance and availability of a particular network. However, with [Wowen](https://wowen.io), you can surpass these limitations and construct a dApp that is both dependable and cost-effective, thanks to the implementation of delegated consensus.

## Enable interaction with data living outside [Wowen](https://wowen.io)

Blockchain oracles act as intermediaries enabling seamless integration of real-world data and events with blockchain networks. Design and develop a robust and secure solution for [Wowen](https://wowen.io). It should be capable of retrieving, validating, and delivering real-world data (both from off-chain and cross-chain sources) to smart contracts running on the Wowen blockchain, enabling interactions with other blockchains.

## Micropayments for IoT

Building a solution for efficient Ethereum-based micropayments within an IoT ecosystem presents several challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and cost efficiency. The challenge is to design and implement a micropayments system that can handle IoT devices generating a high volume of micropayments while minimizing transaction costs on the Wowen network. Try to exploit the [Wowen](https://wowen.io)'s unique feature, the consensus selection per transaction specially engineered for cost optimization, efficiency and scalability. (IoT hardware is not required; you can use any IoT device simulator/emulator).

Join us in redefining the future of IoT micropayments using the powerful capabilities of the [Wowen](https://wowen.io) platform. Let's engineer the new era of IoT micropayment transactions together with [Wowen](https://wowen.io)!

## Delegated consensus verification

Prototype a different verification module that is capable of verifying the transactions that acquired consensus from the external chains, that can be integrated with [Wowen](https://wowen.io). Keep in mind that [Wowen](https://wowen.io) implements most used Ethereum JSON-RPC API as well as custom JSON-RPC API (check the docs). Examples:

- A system that generates a proof from a transaction that is verifiable using the proof itself, the state of [Wowen](https://wowen.io) and the transaction hash available in the external chain.

- A system that, given a transaction hash from the external chain, retrieves all the previously executed transactions and verifies that the obtained state matches the one in [Wowen](https://wowen.io).

## Idea proposition

Decentralised applications, connections with other chains and/or external data, micropayments solution, or delegated consensus verification, but none of the above is suitable for what you were thinking? Reach us with your own innovative idea using Wowen and ask for approval from the [Wowen](https://wowen.io) team!

# Judging criteria

The jury will evaluate each project based on the following criteria:

## Technical aspect

- How complex was the project to build?

- How well does the project leverage technology?

- Is there a high-quality working prototype?

## Practical aspect

- Is there a concrete use-case for the project ?

- How easy is it to onboard new users?

## Innovation aspect

- How original and innovative is the project?

- Does the project unlock new use cases of the technology?
